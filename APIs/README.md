# APIs

This session introduces web APIs, then walks students through making API requests and parsing responses.

Materials: 
- [Google Slides: APIs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YM2UnZ9JhVPVN8WbLuj142H11MTLE2MdKVKkUY91sXU/edit)
- [Jupyter Notebook: APIs](apis.ipynb)

## Preparation

Could ask students to set up their Yelp Developer accounts and get API keys before the session.

## Learning Goals

- Send requests and receive responses over the web
- Retrieve data from APIs using the requests library
- Parse API responses

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 Mins)

One of the most common ways you'll get data as a data scientist.

### APIs Slides (15 Mins)

Walk through the basics of how the web works. 

### APIs (15 Mins)

Walk through the basics of APIs, endpoints and query parameters. Focus on using the requests library, and the Response methods and attributes they'll need from it. 

### Yelp API (20 Mins)

Have students actually get their own API keys, but share your own if they get stuck. Walk through secrets creation in the Terminal, but say they can just paste in the string as a key if they get stuck.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

Let them know that this won't be required for the project, but can be a nice way to level up any project by getting more data.

## Tips

The end of the notebook has students set up a Yelp app, so make sure you're comfortable helping students with that! Look over the instructions in the notebook. If you've already created the Yelp app & key, your Yelp screen will look different from the screenshot in the notebook.
