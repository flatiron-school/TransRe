# Collaborating with Git

Give students exposure to using branches for collaboration.

Main Materials:
- [Google Slides: Creating Repositories and Collaborating with Git](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Q1G66IAh9Y_oVHj-YyYuA730_1iyE8iHBlYkZjFv7E/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Goals

* Initialize new repositories
* Create branches with git to create parallel versions of a repo
* Create pull requests to merge content on GitHub
* Merge changes into local copies of repos

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)

Remind students of where we left off after the introducing git/github lecture (facilitated by slide 3)

### Talk through Slides (45 minutes)

Part one (slides 4-5) is focused on creating a new repository. Specifically, you want to point out the options on the github page when creating new repos (highlighted on Slide 5) because students often misunderstand what is meant by those options when trying to create new repositories.

Part two (slides 6-8) is focused on branches and merges. Emphasize the "Branching Workflow" as opposed to the "Forking Workflow": Branches are short-lived constructions to achieve particular purposes. Best practice is to keep the main branch inviolate and not to do your work on that branch. Therefore collaborators should work on separate branches. Discuss how we typically use collaborator names as branch names, but that's often not best practice.

## Tips

This lecture should be accompanied by some kind of live demonstration or activity. The live demonstration can happen throughout the deck - showcase each of the steps, demonstrating what creating new repos and branches actually looks like. As for the activity to get students to practice, there is a [Git Practice supplementary activity](https://github.com/flatiron-school/DS-Instructor-Content/tree/main/Communication/GitHub-Collaboration/Supplements/GuidedGitGifStravaganza) which can be run, but requires some set up in advance from instructors. Slide 9 is left blank intentionally to facilitate whatever activity the instructor would like to run to help students practice.
