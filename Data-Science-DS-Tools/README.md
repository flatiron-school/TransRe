# Data Science and the Data Scientist Toolkit

This lecture introduces what exactly a data scientist does, including the different roles involved in "data science" (like data engineer or data analyst) and the data science process. It also situates the tools we'll use in Phase 1 relative to data science more broadly.

This deck is designed to be flexible, so it can come either before or after a more program-specific Program Introduction deck (which has more specifics about Canvas, Illumidesk, etc).

## Before Lecture Prep

Instructors should go through and review the contents of the blog post links on Slide 4 if they intend to run the activity (and check if the links still work). There are summaries of the links and some main takeaways in the slide notes - if any of the links break at some point (which can happen over time), you might consider replacing the link with something that captures something similar or removing the link and running fewer groups for that activity. It is also possible to run the slide deck without Slides 4 & 5, removing that 20ish minute activity.

Please note: if you provide students with the link to the slides before the session, they might have access to the slide notes, where the activity links are summarized - not necessarily a bad thing, but it might make the activity less engaging if students simply read off those spoilers instead of skimming the posts.

## Learning Goals

* Define what a 'data scientist' does at a high level
* Recognize what skills fall under the "data science" umbrella
* Recognize the different job titles that are all under the "data science" umbrella
* Outline the data science process
* Get to know our core technical tools, and recognize what problems they solve

## Lesson Plan - 60-70 minutes

### Introduction (5 Mins) - Slides 1 & 2

Introduce yourself (if necessary), explain where to find the slides or where the slides will be shared after the session, and discuss the agenda.

### What is Data Science? (5 Mins) - Slide 3

Pause on Slide 3 and let the students come up with a few answers to the question "What is Data Science?". Highlight key terms, which might include things like "inference", "modeling", "big data", etc.

Fun to let students think about what science ISN'T done on data - obviously, all science uses data, so what makes data science different than just science?

This slide is used to help students start recognizing early that there are no easy answers or simple definitions.

### Blog Post Exploration Activity (20-25 Mins) - Slides 4 & 5

Assign students out into the same number of groups as there are links (easy to do with breakout rooms - the breakout room number then becomes that group's assigned link). Make sure students have the link to their post if you did not share slides in advance. Let students read in groups for about 10 minutes - can be nice to introduce the fact that students can share their own screens, to help facilitate the discussion in the groups.

After 10 minutes, bring the groups back together and have each group discuss what they learned - you can use the slide notes to make sure students pick up on the right trends and also highlight interesting points in the posts.

Slide 5 might be overkill if students summarized each post well, but try to encourage them to at least answer that last question, about what similarities and differences they might have picked up on, to see what trends they're seeing already.

### DS Skills, Roles & Responsibilities (10 minutes) - Slides 6-11

These slides basically summarize the key takeaways from some of the posts, related to the skills, roles and responsibilities of data scientists. 

The data scientist definition on Slide 6 is nice and broad, and it's nice to highlight that there are no neat boxes or clean lines between roles because of how the role of the data scientist has evolved from other roles and disciplines. The Venn diagrams, all stemming from Drew Conway's original on Slide 7, highlight the overlap between skills - can be nice to point out that there is a place for students to find their own niche. Slide 10 is one of many - might highlight here that this is one person/organization's take on these roles, but it's nice to point out that Python is vital in most DS-related roles, and that these are four common job titles in this space. Slide 11 helps connect this focus on skills/roles/responsibilities to the next focus, on the DS Process.

### The Data Science Process (5 minutes) - Slides 12-15

Key here is to highlight how the process is iterative, and the arrows aren't direct. Highlight how the terms are different across these, but the process order remains largely the same - but the DS process is not a one-way street, and often involves moving back and forth between steps within the process. 

Nice to point out that the names "CRISP-DM" and "OSEMN" are common enough as named examples of this process that it lends legitimacy, and we'll want them to define their process in these terms when working on projects. Plus these names could hypothetically come up in a job interview.

### DS Tools (10 minutes) - Slides 16-21

These tools specifically focus on what students will be exposed to in Phase 1, broken into four buckets (languages, interfaces, version control, and package control).

It's nice to highlight how these tools connect, and the difference between version and package control. The slide notes provide a lot of talking points as well.

### Conclusion (5-10 Mins) - Slide 22

Open Q&A, provide instructions for finishing setup if students haven't already, and for getting support from staff if they need help.
