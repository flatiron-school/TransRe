# Python Review: Variables, Data Types and Loops

## Materials

- [Jupyter Notebook: Python Review (blank)](Python-Review_blank.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook: Python Review (complete)](Python-Review_complete.ipynb)

This is intended to be a _very_ basic review of python, and can be run either as a guided practice session or provided to students as additional practice or a pair programming exercise. The `blank` version would be given to students, the `complete` version is an answer key.

## Learning Objectives 

Students will practice: 

- Assigning variables
- Classifying and explaining data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and tuples)
- Identifying comparators and boolean operators to create conditional code
- Making use of lists: indexing, appending, and joining them
- Making use of dictionaries: identifying, creating, and navigating them
- Moving between lists and dictionaries (zipping lists together to make dictionaries, or pulling relevant data from a dictionary into a list)
- Applying for loops to lists and dictionaries
