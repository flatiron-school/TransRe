# Python - Loops and Functions

## Materials

- [Jupyter Notebook: Python Loops and Functions (blank)](Python-Loops-and-Functions_blank.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook: Python Loops and Functions (complete)](Python-Loops-and-Functions_complete.ipynb)

This can be run either as a guided practice session or provided to students as additional practice or a pair programming exercise. The `blank` version would be given to students, the `complete` version is an answer key.

## Learning Objectives

- Revisit what we can do with for loops, using dictionaries
- Recognize function arguments, and write functions both with and without arguments (and with default values!)
- Write functions that build up from for loops

## Lesson Plan - 1 hour (not including level up)

### Introduction (5 minutes)

Since this is likely run early on, it can be nice to demonstrate cloning down and accessing the repo locally (unless you're running this on IllumiDesk or something).

### Loops, Conditionals, and Dictionaries (15 minutes)

Run through building for loops, introduce using `zip` with two lists to make a dictionary, walk through using two variables in a for loop to access both the key and value of a dictionary using `items`, and add in conditionals to the loops.

### Functions (15 minutes)

Discuss the difference between `print` and `return`, and showcase how you adapt a working for loop to become a function. You can go ahead and discuss docstrings, as the function in this section has one provided, but do know that those are discussed again later on.

### Nested Dictionaries (20 minutes)

Walk through how to access the levels of a nested dictionary - while sometimes students will come up with a solution that does not require nested for loops, try to demonstrate an accessible way to access the nested information using loops. Then, let students work on making the next function - easiest way may be to give 5-10 minutes in breakout rooms to write the next function that replicates what the nested for loops were doing. Come back together and have students share their solutions.

### Conclusion (5 minutes)

Introduce the level up for students to do on their own time, explaining docstrings and potentially introducing f-strings.

### Level Up

If you'd like to let students work on this and make this session longer, I'd budget about 20 minutes more - 10 minutes to let students level up the function in small groups, then 10 minutes to come together and discuss solutions and doc string best practices.
