## Learning Objectives

- List a few skills that all conglomerate into data science
- Explain the types of problems that data science can solve
- Describe the data science process

## Lesson Plan - approx. 45 minutes

### Introduction (5 minutes)

### Read and Discuss (25 minutes) - optional

The third slide has links to five blog-style posts (one has a video, but there's a summary underneath) - split the students into 5 groups (can create 5 breakout rooms) and assign each group one of the posts to skim for about 5 minutes. After they've had a chance to look over the post, bring everyone back together and have a few students summarize the posts.

For instructors, note that the slide notes has a high level summary for each post of what students hopefully will call out/pick up on.

On the fourth slide are questions intended to consolidate the general findings from those posts, for a broader understanding.

If you choose not to run through these exercises (you can hide the slides), it may be nice to share out these links and the key findings from the slide notes as additional resources to students.

### High Level Overview (10 minutes)

Now, it's the instructor's turn - walk through the venn diagrams capturing the role of a Data Scientist, the skills involved, what questions DS can answer, the DS process. All of these are intended to both introduce and complicate the understanding of what a data scientist does - students should get a sense that this is a broad field with no set path, but also that there are limits in the sense that DS can only answer certain questions and should follow a certain type of process.

### Conclusion (5 minutes)

Summarize takeaways for students
