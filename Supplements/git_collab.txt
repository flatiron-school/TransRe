Let's follow this workflow.

Person A (already done!):

1. Checkout a new branch and edit the README.
2. Push your new branch to the repo on GitHub and make a pull request.

Person B:
1. Accept the pull request and then pull the changes (to the README) down to your local copy.
2. Checkout a new branch called "code_add" and create a new .py file.
3. Add a function to the .py file that will input a list of strings, remove the whitespace from each, and then return the string that is alphabetically first (use 'min()').
4. Push your new branch to the repo on GitHub (don't forget the -u flag!) and make a pull request.

Together:
0. Make sure your remote is YOUR FORK and not the flatiron-school version!
1. Make a new branch with your name.
2. Edit the README.
3. Push your branch up to your fork to see the branch on GitHub.

Merge Conflict:

1. Checkout a new branch and add a notebook called "final_notebook". Add some imports.
2. Push the changes up to the remote.
3. Make a pull request and merge in the changes.
4. Checkout the main branch and add "final_notebook" but this time add a header as well as the imports.
5. Try to push the changes up to the remote and see the conflict.
6. Try to pull in the new changes and see the merge conflict.
7. Edit the notebook on GitHub or in an editor.
8. Add and commit the changes.
9. Push the changes up.

Importing custom functions:

1. Build a src folder with a __init__.py to make custom functions importable.
2. Move the .py file to src.
3. Import the function in a notebook.
