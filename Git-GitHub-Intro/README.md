# Git Introduciton

Main Materials:
- [Google Slides: Introducing Git and GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SOQBauuhUYVO8vyr1bZQjL1_MPkgwi1rhoazlElKZJ4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Goals

- Fork (GUI) and clone (CLI) repos
- Make changes and push to fork
- Run `git status`, `git log`, `git remote` to understand the structure of repos and of changes made

## Lesson Plan

Note: more detailed support is available in the slide notes.

### Introduction (5 Mins)

Remind students of how Git and GitHub were first introduced, and walk through today's learning objectives

### Slides and Live Demo (50 Mins)

Slides 3-5 are introductory: discuss what Git/GitHub are designed to avoid, and remind students that Git and GitHub are not the same things.

Slide 6 gives a link to a lab - the intention is that, for every step in later slides, the Instructor will demonstrate that step live using the lab's repository.

Slides 7-8 showcase forking and cloning.

Slide 9 is where you can make local changes, for example editing the Jupyter notebook.

Slides 10-16 showcase the process of adding, committing, and pushing changes, and using `git status` to check in on progress. Demonstrate each step, using `git status` in between to showcase how it tells you the next step. You can also use this time to demonstrate `git log` and `git remote -v` - these are not explicitly mentioned in the slides or slide notes, but should be demonstrated so students realize how to check commits or check their remote locations.
    - Note: Slides 11, 14, and 16 are memes, and you could hide those if you didn't want to include them

Slides 17-18 give a bigger picture, and introduce pulling changes.

Slide 19 is a recap - the contents in the "What haven't we covered?" box are then covered in the second Git/GitHub lecture, on collaboration.

Slide 20 has additional resources.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

Answer questions and wrap up.
